## User Story
AS AN HR director,
I WANT TO view all of the company's employees in a sortable table,
SO THAT I have easy and organized access to our the company's employee pool.

## How It Works
![homepage](./images/homepage.png "Homepage!")

Currently, there are five employees that are hard-coded into the database. The user has the option to add additional employees by clicking the plus sign in the upper right hand corner.
![add](./images/addemp.png "Add!")

Then, the user can sort the employees by the categories listed. For example, we can sort by their role by clicking on the "Position" category.
![sort](./images/sorted.png "Sorted!")

If we choose to delete an employee, the user can click the garbage can icon, and then will be prompted with a delete verification.
![delete](./images/delete.png "Deleted!")
